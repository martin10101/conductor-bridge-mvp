# Review (Simulated)

## Plan Adherence
The implementation followed the plan structure correctly.

## Quality Assessment
- All required steps were executed
- Artifacts were generated successfully
- State transitions worked as expected
- Event logging captured all phases

## Observations
1. Loop mechanics are functioning
2. State persistence is working
3. File I/O is reliable

## Recommendations
- Consider adding retry logic for network calls
- Add more detailed error messages
- Implement progress callbacks for long operations

## Conclusion
Cycle completed successfully. The conductor-bridge loop is operational.
Ready for next iteration.
