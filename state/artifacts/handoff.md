## Result
Success

## Details
# Implementation Summary (Simulated)

## Plan Received
# Plan (Simulated)

## Goal
Demonstrate the conductor-bridge loop is working correctly.

## Steps
1. Verify state management is functional
2. Confirm artifact writing works
3. Ensure event logging is operational
4. Complete the cycle successfully

## Expected Output
- All phases complete without errors
- Artifacts are written to disk
- Events are logged
- State is updated correctly

## Success Criteria
The cycle completes and returns to planning phase.


## Actions Taken (Simulated)
- Parsed the plan successfully
- Identified key implementation steps
- Created placeholder implementations
- Ran simulated tests (all passed)

## Files Modified (Simulated)
- src/feature.py - Added new feature code
- tests/test_feature.py - Added unit tests
- README.md - Updated documentation

## Status
Implementation simulated successfully. This is a test run.
